Could you have any chama structure and processes ideas you could share with me like how will the chama operate?, what will the chama operation entail? who will be able to create a chama? where do you want the m-chama to operate(region wise)?how will the chama payments be stored(individual chama group accounts or in m-chama accounts)? how will you collect subscriptions?


1. Monthly subscription 10 bob .
2. Chama should have 7 people Max 
3. There is a paybill of each group. If you don't pay fuliza may deduct to cater for chama 
4. Each day has everyone who gets the chama cash. Maybe you enlighten me on more about cash storage 
5. For subscription collection is part of registration
